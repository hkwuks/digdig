# Repository documents

This index is the authoritative routing and check record for repository documents. The documents at their repository-relative source paths remain authoritative for policy content. Maintain this record first, route by phase from it, then read the routed sources. Do not copy source policy text here.

## Personal rules

Personal rules live in `TaskFlowDocs/repository-docs/personal.md`: one file, each rule in its own section with its own scope. They are local-only, never committed, and cannot override repository documents.
The table names that path as a routing location and marks it `Exists: local`. Whether a personal rule is present in this clone is reported on the session route line, not here: this file is committed and cannot carry a local-only fact without going permanently modified on the machines that have one.
